# Alchemy University: Ethereum Developer Bootcamp

This repository is solely meant to be my zone for the exercises and research I do while working towards completion of the [Alchemy University - Ethereum Developer Bootcamp](https://university.alchemy.com/). As someone fortunate enough to have been granted early access I completed the JavaScript Fundamentals Course as a refresher and am now continuing my journey to become a web3 developer through AU's Ethereum Bootcamp.

A large reason for this repo is as a record of my learnings and solutions to problems. In the future, other AU students may utilize my repo as a resource to supplement their studies, but I implore you to take the time to digest the bugs and exercises you encounter and don't rush to complete the lessons. You will only be hindering yourself. However, feel free to use this repo to boost your understanding, and of course, as all developers do, mutate my creations to your heart's content, but just ensure you understand the code you are using or you will find yourself very frustrated very quickly.
